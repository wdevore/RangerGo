# RangerGo
**RangerGo** A variation of the [Ranger Dart](https://github.com/wdevore/Ranger-Dart) game engine but written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), and possibly [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/).

# Current Tasks and Goals
* **Done** Node Dragging
* **Done** Filters: transform and translate
* **Done** Zoom Node
* **Done** Interpolation
* **Done** Simple motion animations
* **Done** Circle, AABB
* **Done** AnchorNode
* **Done** Particles
* **Done** Animation (tweening) -- Using tanema's library
* **Working** Box2D physics (with space ships)
* OpenGL Vulkan
* Zones
* Audio (SFXR 8bit sound)
* Sprite Textures
* Finish lower case Vector font characters.
* Enhance raster fonts to allow transforms
* Joysticks

## Notes

# Tracking (Optional)
Some **Nodes**/**Objects** may want to *Track* the properties of another **Node**.

For example, an AABB object may wan't to track **Mesh** changes on a node such that it can *rebuild* its internal min/max properties.
